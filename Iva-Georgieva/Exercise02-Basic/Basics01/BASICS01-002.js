/* BASICS01-002: Imagine, you are solving a math problem. Declare ten variables, which you might need in your program.

 The math problem to solve:
     We need to calculate the perimeters of a circle, rectangle and triangle and sum those perimeters.*/


let pi = 3.14 ;
let r = 3 ; // radius
let P1 = 2 * pi * r ; // perimeter of the circle 
let x1 = 10 ; // lenght
let x2 = 5 ; // breadth
let P2 = 2 * x1 + 2 * x2 // perimeter of the rectabgle 
let y1 = 7 ; // side of the triangle
let y2 = y1 ; //the second side of the triangle
let c = 4 ; // based of the triangle 
let P3 = 2 * y1 + c ; // perimeter of the triangle
let P4 = P1 + P2 + P3 //sum of the all perimeters
